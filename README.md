# Land-Use-and-Land-Cover-LULC-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using satellite imagery and deep learning techniques. It leverages the EuroSAT dataset, a benchmark dataset specifically designed for LULC classification, which consists of Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 10 different land use and land cover classes.
